# Change Calculator

At the last minute, you've been asked to work on team developing a module for an automated check-out system of a nationally based grocery store. The app you're building will accept two inputs:

- The amount due for a sale.
- The amount given by the customer. 

When the user clicks on a Calculate button, your app should calculate the amount of change due in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies. For example, if the amount due is 12.34 and the amount given is 20, your app should output the following:

- Dollars: 7
- Quarters: 2
- Dimes: 1
- Nickels: 1
- Pennies: 1

## Advice
- You will need to use an operator not covered in class - the % operator (AKA the modulo/remainder operator).
- Prioritize functionality > styling at first.
- Use Bootstrap to style your app once functionality is done.
