### What is a web application?

- User Data

- Client Applications

- Web / Desktop / Mobile / SMS / Voice

- Software as a Service (SaaS)

Note: Most of the interaction users have their data is through some kind of client application, be it:

- A website
- A web application (such as Chase Bank / Wells Fargo), 
- A desktop application (such as Slack, Dropbox, Resilio),
- A mobile application (such as Facebook/Snapchat/Instagram)
- A voice recognition device (such as Amazon Alexa/Google Home/Apple HomePod).

Most companies will offer one or more of these types of client applications to help users manage their data. A web application then is just one of the ways that companies offer software as a service.

### Frontend vs Backend

- Both "frontend" and "backend" are abstract categories for different types of development.
- Vague terms scientifically, helpful for team communication.
- Frontend: Software that users visually see and interact with
- Backend: Software that powers frontend software behind the scenes.
